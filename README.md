# TextMetaDemoApp

This is a demo web application that allows for uploading of PDFs and rules to be processed by the [TextMeta](https://github.com/m-gagne/TextMeta) node module.

## What is TextMeta?

[TextMeta](https://github.com/m-gagne/TextMeta) is a simple utility module that makes it easy to extract text and metadata from PDFs. The text is extracted using [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) and the metadat is extracted using a simple regex based rules engine ([detailed here](https://github.com/m-gagne/textmeta).)
